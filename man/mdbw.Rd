\details{
While the Gaussian kernel has a free parameter (bandwidth), it still
follows a number of theoretical properties such as boundedness, consistenc, universality, robustness, etc. It is the most applicable one. In a Gaussian RBF kernel, we need to select an appropriate a bandwidth. It is well known that the parameter has a strong influence on the result of kernel methods. For the Gaussian kernel, we can use the median of the pairwise distance as a bandwidth.
